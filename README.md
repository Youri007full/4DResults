<p align="center">  
4DResults is a small demo application based on modern Android application tech-stacks and MVVM architecture.<br>This project is for focusing especially on the new library Dagger-Hilt of implementing dependency injection.<br>
Also fetching data from the network and integrating persisted data in the database via repository pattern.
</p>
<br/>

## Tech stack & Open-source libraries
- Minimum SDK level 21
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) based, [Coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) + [Flow](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/) for asynchronous.
- Dagger-Hilt (alpha) for dependency injection.
- JetPack
  - LiveData - notify domain layer data to views.
  - Lifecycle - dispose of observing data when lifecycle state changes.
  - ViewModel - UI related data holder, lifecycle aware.
  - Room Persistence - construct a database using the abstract layer.
  - navigation - navigate across, into, and back out from the different pieces of content within app.
- Architecture
  - MVVM Architecture (View - DataBinding - ViewModel - Model)
  - Repository pattern
- [Retrofit2 & OkHttp3](https://github.com/square/retrofit) - construct the REST APIs and paging network data.
- [Sandwich](https://github.com/skydoves/Sandwich) - construct lightweight http API response and handling error responses.
- [Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi/) - A modern JSON library for Kotlin and Java.
- [WhatIf](https://github.com/skydoves/whatif) - checking nullable object and empty collections more fluently.
- [Timber](https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber) - logging.

## Architecture
4DResults is based on MVVM architecture and a repository pattern.
